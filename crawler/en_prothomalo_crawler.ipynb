      "Negotiations between trade union leaders of the state-owned Power Development Board (PDB) and state minister for power and energy Nasrul Hamid have broken down without an agreement over the formation of three new power companies opposed by workers.\n",
      "\"We need one or two days more for discussions, as we couldn't agree on some of the points,\" said Nasrul Hamid after emerging from the over one hour-long discussion with PDB collective bargaining agent, or CBA, leaders at his office Sunday.\n",
      "The CBA has been agitating since the past week to protest the government move to form three separate distribution companies for the northern, southern and central regions of the country by breaking up the state-owned principal power sector organisation.\n",
      "One, the North-West Zone Power Distribution Company, has already been formed and is now waiting go into operation. The other two are in the process.\n",
      "Apprehending layoffs, the CAB started their agitation programme, which has since been joined by officers of the PDB under the banner of 'Employees-Officers Unity Council. A stalemate ensued, and the operations of the PDB have since suffered.\n",
      "The state minister himself decided to sit in on the negotiations and take part in them to enhance workers' confidence in the process.\n",
      "According to official sources, at one stage of the meeting, the state minister proposed that the PDB be turned into a holding company that would exercise overall operating control over the three new ones.\n",
      "The CBA and the Union Council were agreeable to this proposal and even accepted it in principle, but conditional on any ongoing work by the North-West Zone Power Distribution Company being suspended immediately, till all three new companies are ready to operate.\n",
      "This did not sit well with the state minister. Nasrul Hamid sees no point in delaying or halting the operations of a new company, arguing that it would ultimately halt the 'entire reform process' now underway in the power sector. One may admire his conviction, as a doer from the world of business, on this point. Equally he may have to concede that no sectoral reform process can succeed without addressing the concerns of its workers.\n",
