Anisul posed a question.The article 96 of the 1972 constitution gave the lawmakers the power to remove judges. The article 116 of the constitution stipulates: “The control (including the power of posting, promotion and grant of leave) and discipline of persons employed in the judicial service and magistrates exercising judicial functions shall vest in the President and shall be exercised by him in consultation with the Supreme Court”. However, as per the constitution of 1972, the control (including the power of posting, promotion and grant of leave) and discipline of persons employed in the judicial service was completely exercised by the Supreme Court. The minister said the government is committed to ensuring independence of the judiciary. He said the state's senior most figure -- the president -- has been entrusted with the duty to oversee transfers, promotions and dismissal of judiciary personnel. His ministry only ensures coordination between the president's office and the Supreme Court. ",0,"18:42, Nov 01, 2016",http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/127377/Law-minister-begs-to-differ-with-CJ

2016-11-01,Musa Ahmed,Hawkers being relocated to Gulistan Park?,"It’s hard to get a glimpse of green in Old Dhaka. Shahid Matiur Shishu Park in Gulistan, popularly known as Gulistan Park, is one of the few places where people of the old city can come close to nature.The park was named after Matiur Rahman, a student who was killed in police firing during the anti-Ayub Khan mass upsurge. The martyrdom of Matiur intensified the movement which ultimately ended the dictatorial rule of Pakistan President General Ayub Khan.However, Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) has decided to temporarily relocate hawkers of Gulistan to the park, raising fears among historians and urban planners that this will rob the park of its beauty and historical significance.The decision came after Dhaka South City Corporation (DSCC) launched a drive to remove illegal shops from the streets of Gulistan area on 27 October. During the eviction, the hawkers clashed repeatedly with some city corporation employees and a group of BCL men.At a meeting on Saturday, DSCC decided to shift the hawkers temporarily to Gulistan Park.Walkways adjacent to Golap Shah Mazar, National Book Centre, Bangabandhu Avenue, Khoddor Bazaar Shopping complex in Gulistan were still occupied by the hawkers on Sunday. The scenery inside the park is not very pleasant either. On a visit to the park on Sunday, this correspondent saw it was crowded with homeless people and goats. Garbage floated on the pond.Garbage was also piled up against the wall near the theatre house, Mohanagar Natya Mancha. DSCC officials said hawkers will be given a place to open their shops in this part of the park.Dhaka University’s history department professor Muntasir Mamun told Prothom Alo on Sunday that the park’s natural beauty has been marred since since 1990. He urged DSCC to rescind their decision, saying that if the hawkers were shifted inside the park, it will no longer be a park at all.Architect and urban planner Iqbal Habib said the hawkers cannot be shifted temporarily to the park as per the laws pertaining to open spaces and playgrounds in the metropolis.He said Gulistan hawker eviction was a political problem that has to be resolved politically.When asked about this question of legality, DSCC mayor Sayeed Khokon said the hawkers will be given a place to open their shops adjacent to Mohanagar Natya Mancha, not in Gulistan Park. Mohanagar Natya Mancha and Gulistan Park are two different places as per the city survey, the mayor said.He warned that no hawkers could occupy footpath illegally in the future. The hawkers themselves are unwilling to shift to the park. DSCC’s listed hawker Amjad Ali and Mainuddin Mia said they will not leave the walkways until permanent rehabilitation of any sort is arranged. They said customers will not enter the park to shop.Hawker MujiburRahman, Alauddin and Mofizul Islam said that local politicians and law enforcing agency members discouraged them from opening their shops inside the park because if that happens, they could not collect extortion money from them.Javed Jahan, resident of the city’s Siddik Bazar area and a green activist, said, “This park’s beauty has already been marred by the Natya Mancha. It needs renovation instead of being crowded by hawkers.”",0,"22:56, Oct 31, 2016",http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/127313/Hawkers-being-relocated-to-Gulistan-Park

Sabbir regularly held meetings with other BCL members and friends there.In a phone call on Thursday night, Sabbir avoided answering Prothom Alo’s question about where and how he obtained the weapon. When contacted again on Friday night, Sabbir rejected phone calls and refused to talk to Prothom Alo.Local residents of Wari said that Ashikur also regularly harassed shop owners in Kaptanbazar with the help of his associates. However, he was not seen in the area on Friday. Ashikur avoided answering a number of phone calls made by Prothom Alo on both Thursday and Friday.Police officers said no cases regarding extortion or any other issues were filed against these two BCL members.BCL president of the central committee Saifur Rahman told Prothom Alo, “We are currently inquiring into this matter.

2016-11-01,Online Desk,3 studies before implementing Cox’s Bazar LNG project,"Power Cell, a Power Division technical wing, has moved to conduct three comprehensive studies prior to implementing its 500 mmcfd capacity onshore LNG project in Cox’s Bazar, reports news agency UNB.The studies will be carried out engaging international consulting firms to assess the technical, financial and environment aspects of the LNG (liquefied natural gas) project, said officials at the Power Cell.According to them, the Power Cell has already received proposals from 12 international firms for the three studies. Five of them have submitted bids for a technical study, three for a financial study and four for an environmental study.“We’re now evaluating their bid documents to select three of them. Each of the final three will be selected for one study,” Power Cell director general Mohammad Hossain told UNB.Once the evaluation is completed, he said, they will seek approval from the Power Division for their appointment.Earlier, the Power Cell had selected four international firms for setting up an onshore LNG terminal with re-gasification facilities of 500 mmcfd gas per day on build-own-operate (BOO) basis.The main objective of the project is to provide gas supply to the gas-based public and private sector power plants in the future if and when the local gas production and supply will be depleting. World Bank’s commercial wing International Finance Corporation (IFC) has been supporting the move.But at that stage of the selection process, the donor agency advised the government to conduct the three studies first before proceeding for any contract with any firm, said a Power Cell official adding, “Because, such studies are very essential to determine the technical, financial and environment viabilities of the project.”Without any feasibility study on these three aspects, no international bidder will take any risk and similarly, nor any financial agency will come up to finance the project, he said.The Power Cell official also informed that primarily two possible sites-Materbari and Pekua-were chosen for the LNG project. Now Moheshkhali is included as possible site for the project.“But after the three studies, on the basis of the study-findings, one of the three locations will be finalised for the project,” he added.The planned onshore terminal will be the country’s second liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal. The Power Cell floated tender in mid-April last year, seeking expressions of interest (EOIs) from international companies to build the onshore LNG import terminal.The government has already signed a contract with a Singaporean firm to set up a similar capacity LNG terminal with floating storage and re-gasification unit (FSRU) in the offshore of Moheshkhali Island.State-owned Petrobangla is implementing the Moheshkhali LNG terminal project, which will import LNG and then take the storage and re-gasification service from the terminal and supply it to the country’s gas network.But the Power Cell-moved one will be set up as an onshore storage and re-gasification LNG terminal. The Power Cell will import LNG and take service from the terminal to supply the gas to the public and private power plants.",0,"16:36, Oct 29, 2016",http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/126977/3-studies-before-implementing-Cox%E2%80%99s-Bazar-LNG

2016-11-01,Online Desk,BSF mulls to deploy more floating border outposts along Bangladesh border: HT,"Indian daily Hindustan Times has reported that India’s Border Security Force (BSF) decided to deploy six to seven floating border outposts (BOP) next year, in a bid to strengthen vigil along the riverine border with Bangladesh.Currently, the Indian daily said in an article written by Bibhas Bhattacharyya published on its digital version on Saturday said, there are three BOPs that keep surveillance in the Sunderbans.However, it added, the BSF has refused to divulge the number of BOPs that it is going to deploy.“In order to strengthen vigil, we are going to install more BOPs along our riverine border,” P S R Anjaneyulu, inspector general, BSF, South Bengal Frontier, told HT.The vigil along Bangladesh border has increased after the infiltration of the eastern neighbour of India by IS elements, and especially since the massacre in Dhaka’s Holey Artisan Bakery on 1 July when 20 hostages (18 foreigners, two locals) people were killed, said the report.It said: Even earlier guarding the waters became extremely important for the country since 2008 when 10 members of Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) carried out serial attacks in Mumbai after crossing the seas and landing in Mumbai.“The attack lasted for four days, snuffed out 164 lives and came to be recognised as a milestone in the terrorist activities in the modern world.”“After this incident,” the HT article said, “the Union government stepped up vigil in every riverine area that is sharing borders with another country, and at the same time asked every state government to strengthen vigil. Bengal government has also increased the number of costal police stations in Bengal and purchased modern equipment like speed boats, and installed radars.”“About 35-40 personnel posted in each BOP and four to five speedboats are deployed for every such outpost. These boats roam around the area in close coordination with the police and other security agencies that are also working in border area,” a BSF officer told the HT, requesting anonymity.According to him, the installation of floating BOPs may take nearly one year, it added.The article reads: The Ichamati river marks the border between Bangladesh and south Bengal for quite some distance. The total stretch of this area is about 80 km where the new BoPs will be deployed.“The Sunderbans is the main border area and there are 102 islands in this area where 54 islands are inhabited by humans. The rest of the islands mainly consist of dense forests and wildlife habitats.”“Our men are already keeping round the clock vigil in the area. But after BOPs are installed, the level of vigil will go up further,” R P S Jaswal, the DIG, BSF, (South Bengal Frontier) was quoted by HT.The article reads: Since the new government assumed power to the Centre, BSF was asked to step up vigil in the border with Bangladesh. It has also sharply reduced the number of cattle that are smuggled through the land in Bangladesh.After the BSF dug up trenches along the border area to stop cattle smuggling, smugglers tried to send cattle through waterways. There are several incidents where BSF with their speedboats chased these smugglers, caught them and seized cattle, added the report.",0,"17:46, Oct 29, 2016",http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/126989/BSF-mulls-to-deploy-more-floating-border-outposts

2016-11-01,Online Desk,Eye-wash search committee to bring no benefit: Ex-CEC,"Former chief election commissioner ATM Shamsul Huda on Saturday called for initiating a process right now for the reconstitution of a strong election commission on the basis of opinions of all political parties, reports UNB.“The tenure of present election commission will expire in mid-February next. It’s essential to initiate the process of reconstitution of the EC right now if we want to form a strong one,” Shamsul Huda, whose commission presided over the 2008 election, told a debate programme in the capital city.A non-government organisation called Debate for Democracy arranged the debate styled ‘public parliament’ on the role of election commission, candidates and people to arrange a fair election’ at the auditorium of Bangladesh Film Development Corporation.Noting that the election commission was reconstituted in 2012 within a very short time, the ex-CEC said, “If we form the search committee today, publish the names of potential commissioners tomorrow and appoint them the day after tomorrow then such eye-wash search committee will bring no benefit.”He said any election without the participation of all parties must be a problematic one. “So, reconstitute the EC on the basis of all political parties and create an environment so that all parties will participate in it. If so, the fair election will be possible and no one will have the scope to raise question about the election in case of suffering defeat.”Huda said now the immediate priority should be to reconstitute a strong EC with person having competence, neutrality and integrity for getting good result to some extent.“I strongly believe there’re many competent persons in our country, who’re eligible for Election Commissioner’s post. Unfortunately, we don’t search them,” he said.He said if the EC is formed right way, the commission will be able to recover its trust gap with political parties. “But, it won’t be possible if the participation of all political parties is not ensured. If one particular party plays the role in reconstituting the EC while other parties have no role, the EC will become controversial and polls will be questionable even though it arranges a fair election.”In Bangladesh, it’s not possible to arrange fair election emphasising a particular element such as EC. A strong EC cannot alone arrange a fair election as all elements, including political parties, administration and people are important here, Huda said.The former CEC said when they were election commissioners (2007-2012), they proposed staggered election to give more concentration in arrangement of the polls in a fairer manner, but political parties did not support them due to lack of confidence.“There’s a trust deficit within our state institutions and its now at extreme stage. One institution doesn’t trust another. Political parties don’t trust the EC. And EC also doesn’t trust political parties. There’s no trust in governance,” he said.The ex-CEC, however, said the EC in Bangladesh enjoys more power than that of India. “But we can’t arrange credible election like India.”The former CEC said the EC has no special role or central role in arranging a fair election in many western countries unlike Bangladesh.In the US presidential election, the EC has no central role. US president Barack Obama engaged in election campaign, which is not possible in Bangladesh as there are many restrictions during the electioneering here, he said.Citing the example of Australia, he said there are no security men to protect polling stations there and people oversee the election amid enthusiasm. Tea and coffee can be entertained nearby the polling booth, which is restricted in Bangladesh.Noting that a long-term plan is needed to build a fair electoral system in Bangladesh, Huda said it is essential to enact a law incorporating provision for qualifications and disqualifications and the terms and conditions for the election commissioners.Debaters of BGMEA University Fashion and Technology acted as the ruling party in the public parliament, while debaters of Primeasia University as the opposition. The Primeasia University team won the debate.",0,"18:18, Oct 29, 2016",http://en.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/news/126993/Eye-wash-search-committee-to-bring-no-benefit
